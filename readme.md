# Welcome to the xDAC

xDAC is a self-governed platform for creating and managing Decentralized Autonomous Companies.

As a subclass of DAO, an xDAC is a company on a decentralized network with a built-in Proof of Work (PoW) incentive mechanism, a comprehensive set of governance and management tools, and a support system for DApps and Autonomous Agents - all housed on top of EOS. The xDAC governance is regulated by an xDAC platform â€“ designed as a self-sustainable decentralized ecosystem consisting of businesses motivated to reap the benefits of their success without geographical limitations.
